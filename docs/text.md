# `cldfviz.text`

A rather traditional visualization of linguistic data is the practice of interspersing bits of data
in descriptive texts, most obviously perhaps as examples formatted as **I**nterlinear **G**lossed **T**ext.
Other examples of data in text include forms, either in running text or in a table, or just references.

To support this use case, the `cldfviz.text` command can fill data from a CLDF dataset into a markdown
document, where references to CLDF data objects (rows of tables or complete tables) are marked using
markdown links.

While this process may seem overly complex - after all, you could just type an IGT example into your document - there
are advantages:
1. Valuable structured data can be made available as CLDF data, thus opening it up for re-use (and various
   attempts to extract IGT from text documents are proof that this content is considered valuable).
2. Rendering of structured data can be made more uniform and automatic - thereby simplifying authoring of such
   documents.

Basically, we want to have data in two places, and the better authoritative place for it seems to be the CLDF dataset.
With `cldfviz.text` we want to make it easier to "pull data back into text".


## Syntax

"CLDF markdown" is just [regular markdown](https://commonmark.org/) where URLs specified in [markdown links](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#links)
may be interpreted as references to objects in a CLDF dataset.

The link syntax to reference a single object, i.e. a row in a CLDF table looks as follows:
```
[An arbitrary label](some/path/<component-name-or-csv-filename>#cldf:<obect-id>)
```

To reference all rows in a table, use
```
[An arbitrary label](some/path/<component-name-or-csv-filename>#cldf:__all__)
```

Note: Only the last component of the URL path is used to determine a CLDF component or table of the dataset, while
the first part is ignored. This allows using URLs that are even somewhat functional in the unrendered
document. E.g.
```
[Meier 2020](cldf/sources.bib#cldf:Meier2020)
```
will render as `Meier 2020`, linking to the BibTeX file when the document is simply rendered as markdown by
a service like GitHub, while the enhanced document created from `cldfviz.text` will replace the link with
the reference data expanded to a full citation according to the Unified Stylesheet for Linguistics.


### Referencing data from multiple datasets

To reference objects in multiple datasets, the fragment identifier must start with `cldf-dsid:`, where `dsid` is
an identifier that can be mapped to a dataset by the processing application.


### Passing additional info to processors

CLDF Markdown processors may accept input to customize rendering of CLDF objects. This additional information can
be passed in the [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) of the URL. CLDF Markdown must ignore
unknown parameters (to make CLDF Markdown documents renderable with multiple processors) - but may issue a warning about this
(to give the user feedback about accepted parameters).


### Metadata

CLDF datasets may come with rich metadata, serialized as JSON. To reference (and insert) bits and pieces of this
metadata in CLDF markdown documents, the special component name `Metadata` (or the name of the JSON metadata
file) may be used in the URL. The particular piece of metadata must be selected using [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/)
syntax.

So in the simplest case this could be `[](Metadata#cldf:"dc:license")`. A more complex example would be
```
[](Metadata#cldf:tables[?"dc:conformsTo"=='http://cldf.clld.org/v1.0/terms.rdf#LanguageTable'].url | [0])
```
to select the filename used for the `LanguageTable` component of the dataset.


## Rendering

Rendering of data objects is controled with [templates](../src/cldfviz/templates/text) using the
[Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) template language. Sometimes, templates can be parametrized,
e.g. to choose only cognates belonging to the same cognate set from a `CognateTable`. These parameters can
be specified as [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) of the reference URL, e.g.
```
[cognateset X](some/path/CognateTable?cognatesetReference=X#cldf:__all__)
```

In addition to data objects you can also specify maps to be created with `cldfviz.map` and included in the
resulting markdown document; e.g.:
```
![](map.jpg?parameters=1A#cldfviz.map)
```

An example of a document rendered with `cldfviz.text` is [text_example/README.md](text_example/README.md),
several paragraphs of [WALS' chapter 21](https://wals.info/chapter/21), rewritten in
["CLDF markdown"](text_example/README_tmpl.md) and rendered by "filling in" data from
[WALS as CLDF dataset](https://github.com/cldf-datasets/wals/).


### References

Any object in a CLDF dataset may reference sources. These references are typically rendered by the templates
associated with the object type. Thus, when a complete CLDF markdown document is rendered, it may be desireable
to include a list of all **cited** sources. This is supported as follows:

1. To insert a list of cited references in the document, add the link
   ```
   [References](Source?cited_only#cldf:__all__)
   ```
   at the location where the list should appear.
2. Discovery of cited sources relies on the references being rendered as links. Thus, it is necessary that all
   CLDF markdown links in the document are specified adding the `with_internal_ref_link` URL parameter.


## CLI

```shell
$ cldfbench cldfviz.text -h
usage: cldfbench cldfviz.text [-h] [-l] [--text-string TEXT_STRING]
                              [--text-file TEXT_FILE] [--templates TEMPLATES]
                              [--output OUTPUT]
                              DATASET

positional arguments:
  DATASET               Dataset specification (i.e. path to a CLDF metadata
                        file or to the data file)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l, --list            list templates (default: False)
  --text-string TEXT_STRING
  --text-file TEXT_FILE
  --templates TEMPLATES
  --output OUTPUT
```


## Examples

- Rendering a parameter description from a CLDF StructureDataset:
  ```shell
  $ cldfbench cldfviz.text --text-string "[](ParameterTable#cldf:D)" tests/StructureDataset/StructureDataset-metadata.json
  **Oblique Nouns**
  
  Description:
  Oblique stems of common nouns
  
  Codes:
  - 0: 0
  - 1: 1
  - 2: 2
  ```


## Referencing data from multiple CLDF datasets

While CLDF is designed to make merging data from multiple datasets easy, one may still want to reference data
from multiple datasets in the same CLDF markdown document. This is supported as follows.

The `cldfbench cldfviz.text` command accepts multiple datasets (specified by metadata file). To disambiguate
references, the URL fragment in reference links must also specify the dataset
- either by position in the argument list (starting from "1")
- or using an identifier assigned to the dataset (by appending it separated by `#` to the metadata file).

So for example, you can print sources from two CLDF datasets via
```shell
$ cldfbench cldfviz.text \
  tests/StructureDataset/StructureDataset-metadata.json#peterson tests/Wordlist/Wordlist-metadata.json#list \
  --text-string "[](Source#cldf-peterson:Peterson2017) [](Source#cldf-list:List2014e)"
Peterson, John. 2017. Fitting the pieces together - Towards a linguistic prehistory of eastern-central South Asia (and beyond). Journal of South Asian Languages and Linguistics 4. Walter de Gruyter {GmbH}.
List, J.-M. and ProkiÄ‡, J. 2014. A benchmark database of phonetic alignments in historical linguistics and dialectology.

Reykjavik, Iceland: European Language Resources Association (ELRA).
```

Similarly, for `cldfviz.map` references, use `cldfviz.map-<id>` as URL fragment in the relevant links.
