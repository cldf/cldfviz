Together with fusion and flexivity (i.e. patterns of allomorphy), exponence is one of the parameters of morphological typology. While traditional notions like “agglutinative” and “flexive” conflate these parameters (see 
[](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link=references#cldf:Plank-1999), 
[](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link=references#cldf:Bickel-and-Nichols-2005), 
among others), they are surveyed here separately. For fusion, see Chapter 20; for one dimension of flexivity, see Chapter 59 (on possessive classification).

## 1. Defining exponence

Exponence refers to the number of categories that cumulate into a single 
formative. The universal default is to express each category by a dedicated 
formative. These are **monoexponential** (or separative) formatives. 
**Polyexponential** (or **cumulative**) formatives, i.e. formatives which 
simultaneously code more than one category, are much rarer. A well-known 
example is number and case in many Indo-European 
languages. Marking of case in these languages involves the same formative as 
marking of number, and it is impossible to identify separate markers of case 
and number. Thus, in Russian, 
genitive singular is *-i* or *-a* and genitive plural *-ej* or *-ov* or *-ø*, 
and there is no element in these forms that exclusively expresses case or 
number. When categories are not cumulated into a single formative, each has 
its own separate marker. This is so in Turkish, 
where number is always expressed on nouns by means of the suffix *-ler* and 
for each case there is a separate suffix that can combine with *-ler*, e.g. 
genitive *-in* (plural *-ler-in*), accusative *-i* (plural *-ler-i*), dative 
*-e* (plural *-ler-e*), etc.

Exponence is a purely morphological notion; in particular it is independent 
of the phonological connection between host and formative. Therefore, 
monoexponential formatives can combine with any fusion type (see Chapter 20 
for the definition of fusion types). Thus, the 
Fijian 
past tense formative aa (see example (1) in Chapter 20) is monoexponential 
and isolating. The Turkish past tense formative -ti (and its alternants) 
is monoexponential and concatenative. The 
Kisi 
high tone past perfective formative is monoexponential and nonlinear.

Likewise, polyexponential formatives can combine with any fusion type. An 
isolating polyexponential formative is found in 
Wari’ 
(Chapacura-Wanham; Brazil). In this language, the expression of agreement, 
tense and voice cumulates into a single formative. This formative projects 
its own phonological word, as evidenced by stress assignment, the ability to 
be uttered independently, and the absence of vowel harmony and other 
alternations
([](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link=references#cldf:Everett-and-Kern-1997): 332f.):

The corresponding first and second person formatives are *‘ina* and *ma*, 
respectively. The future forms are *ta’* (1SG), *ra* (2SG), *tara* (3SG), 
the passive forms *xita* (1SG), *xima* (2SG), and *ta* (3SG) — there is no 
consistent internal morpheme structure, hence the formatives are analyzed 
as having cumulative exponence.

The Russian genitive case suffixes mentioned earlier are examples of 
concatenative polyexponential forms. Nonlinear polyexponential formatives are 
common among Semitic languages, where vowel templates express tense, voice and 
agreement simultaneously. 


## 2. Sampling procedure and feature values

We sampled, for each language, one exemplar of a case and one exemplar of a 
tense-aspect-mood formative, following the procedure set out in the chapter 
on “Sampling case and tense formatives”. We were interested in combinations 
of very different categories in one formative, and not for instance in 
combinations of some tense value with some aspect value. Thus, for coding 
purposes we treated tense, aspect, mood, status, and evidentiality as one 
category, and checked whether or not this cumulates with such categories as 
agreement, voice or negation. Many such category combinations are possible, 
but in our sample, we found only those shown on the maps.


### 2.1. Case exponence

Case exponence has a different distribution than tense-aspect-mood exponence, 
but in both instances, polyexponence is rare. Map 21A displays case exponence, 
with the following feature values:
